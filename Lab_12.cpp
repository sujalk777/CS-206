// Once upon a time in the land of Chocovania, there were two magical robots ‚Äî ChocoBot #1 and ChocoBot #2.
// Their mission? To collect as many chocolates as possible from a special chocolate field!

// The field was a grid where every cell had some chocolates, and the robots had their starting positions:

// ChocoBot #1 always starts from the top-left corner (row 0, col 0).
// ChocoBot #2 starts from the top-right corner (row 0, col m - 1). But the field has its own magical rules:

// In each move, both bots move down one row to any of the three nearby columns: stay in the same column, go one step left, or one step right.
// They continue moving like this until they reach the last row.
// Every time a robot visits a cell, it collects all the chocolates there üç¨!
// But! If both robots land on the same cell, only one of them can collect ‚Äî no double dipping allowed!
// The field is bounded ‚Äî bots can't fall off! Your task is to guide both ChocoBots from top to bottom and help them collect as many chocolates as possible together!
